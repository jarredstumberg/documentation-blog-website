# My Introduction to 3D Printing

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, began in the 1980s. The first 3D printer was created by Charles Hull in 1983, using a process called stereolithography. Over the years, the technology has evolved significantly, with various methods such as FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) and SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) becoming popular. Today, 3D printing is used in numerous industries, from healthcare to aerospace, for creating prototypes, tools, and even final products.
